# JavaScript Trivia Game

### Overview

In this assignment, I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. The app layout is created using valid HTML and stylish CSS.



### Basic Quiz (Timed Form)



* I created a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options.

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

  * The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

* The player cannot pick more than one answer per question.

* It includes a countdown timer.
